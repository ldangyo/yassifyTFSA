                        Figuring out what stocks to invest into can be scary.
                        With mutual funds, you can pool your money with other
                        investors to invest in stocks, bonds and other assets.
                        These assets are managed by fund managers whoâ€™s job is
                        for you to secure that bag!

                        Mutual funds allow you to diversify and put your eggs
                        into different baskets

                    <p className="big-text-body">
                        Since your investments are managed by fund managers, you
                        have to pay a Management Expense Ratio (MER). This can
                        depend on what mutual fund you select, so keep an eye on
                        that! For more information about MERs read here:
